# Generate-Lowest-Number

## Problem

You are tasked with implementing a method that returns the lowest possible number that could be generated after removing n characters from a string of digits.The method signature should look like:

```cs
public static string GenerateLowestNumber(string number, int n)
```

Where the number parameter is a string that contains a number(e.g. “4205123”), and the n parameter represents the number of characters to remove from the string. The goal of this method is to return the lowest number that can be generated by removing n characters from the number provided while keeping the positions of the remaining characters relative to each other the same (i.e.the method should remove n characters from the string, but it cannot re-order the characters).

For example, if number is “4205123” and n is 4, the lowest possible number that can be generated after removing any 4 characters is “012”. If number is “216504” and n is 3, the lowest possible number that can be generated after removing 3 characters is “104”.

## Solution

The solution is contained in the Program.cs file with the following notes:

1. My primary effort in this solution was to do this in as little code as possible.  This was accomplished in 34 lines of code; albeit without the use of LINQ, this would be a fair bit longer.
2. Because of point number 1, this code does not perform error checking on user input data (i.e. the user could input a string of characters (instead of numbers), and the program would explode.)
